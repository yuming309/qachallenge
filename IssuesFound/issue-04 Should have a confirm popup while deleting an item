Description: 
 While deleting an item by clicking "X", there is no confirm window/popup to confirm the deletion.
 For a destructive behavior, it should provide a confirmation window to avoid an accident happening.
 
Step to reproduce:
1. Browse to http://todomvc.com/examples/angular2/
      
2. Add some items.
      
3. Move the mouse cursor over one item to display the deleting mark "X".
   Expected Result: "X" shows up on the row of the item.
   
4. Click the "X" to delete the item.
   Expected Result: A deletion confirm window should show up to confirm the deletion.
   
In the step 4, the deletion is executed immediately.
Also while checking checkbox to delete an item, after click "Clear completed" a deletion confirm window should show up.
