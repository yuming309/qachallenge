Description: 
 While deleting an item by checking the checkbox, there displays "Clear completed" and by clicking it, the checked items deleted.
 However this string "Clear completed" does not describe its fuction properly.
 Suggest to change it to "Remove the checked items" or "Delete the checked items".
 
Step to reproduce:
1. Browse to http://todomvc.com/examples/angular2/
      
2. Check the checkbox of one item - "Clear completed" shows up on the bottom right.
