Description: 
  While using Chrome Version 54.0.2840.99 m, after adding a new todo item, the input field shows an arrow symbol instead of a checkbox,
  and the newly created item has a radio button-like checkbox which should be a regular checkbox.
  
Step to reproduce:
1. Browse to http://todomvc.com/examples/angular2/
2. Click the input filed.
3. Type an todo item into the input field, such as "test 1" then press Enter.
   Expected Result: 1. The first thing to do: write the test plan. is added to the below of the input field and a checkbox shows up
                    in front of it. A checkbox displays on the input field in front of the label "What needs to be done?"
                    
In the step 3, a checkbox is supposed to show up in front of the input field, however a down-sided arrow symbol shows up.
Also the newly added item has a radio-button like checkbox showing up which is not compatible of regular UI requirement and 
it should be changed to a square checkbox.
